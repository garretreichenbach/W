# W
## What is W?
W is a simple, fast, and efficient scripting language that prioritizes ease of use and readability. It is designed to be a general-purpose language that can be used for a wide variety of tasks, 
from simple scripting to complex applications.
W is designed to be easy to learn and use, with a simple and clean syntax that is easy to read and write. It is also very compatible with other languages, making it easy to integrate with existing codebases.

W is a dynamically typed language, meaning that variables do not have a fixed type and can change at runtime. Additionally, W is a garbage-collected language, meaning that memory management is handled 
automatically by the runtime. However, the user is also given the option to manually manage memory if desired, and has a lot of control over how memory is allocated and deallocated.

W can be described as "easy to learn, difficult to master". It is designed to be simple and intuitive for beginners, but also powerful and flexible for more advanced users.

## Why W?
W was created to address some of the shortcomings of existing scripting languages. Many scripting languages are either too complex and difficult to learn, or too slow and inefficient to be practical for
real-world use. W aims to strike a balance between ease of use and performance, providing a simple and clean syntax that is easy to learn, while also being fast and efficient enough to be used in
production environments. W also aims to be a jack-of-all-trades language, and you can use it however you want. W can be considered a functional language, an object-oriented language, or a procedural language,
depending on how you choose to use it. W also has a strong emphasis on abstraction and modularity, making it easy to write clean and maintainable code. W is a context-focused language, meaning that
functionalities can depend on the context in which they are used. However, you can easily define your own behavior for any context, making W a very flexible and extensible language.
